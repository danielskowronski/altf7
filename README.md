# altf7
alt+f7 linux functionality (move window shortcut) port for windows

## how to use
to start - just run exe
click alt+f7 and current foreground window (for example freshly alt+tabbed) will move to mouse cursor - you can freely move it around screen until mouse click occurs
currently there is no setup - you have to manually copy altf7.exe from builds/ directory to autorun

## why
windows has such feature but it's hardly accessible - you have to click on window icon in taskbar (since win7 it's even harder)
you can find it extremely usable when window is outside screen (moved there becouse of bug or second screen is powered down etc.)

## current status
early stage but works ;)

## bugs
if you see one - create issue on github or contact me directly - daniel@dsinf.net

## future functions
  - keyboard navigation
  - some configuration
  - installer
